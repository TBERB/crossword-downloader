Written in Bash, this code downloads the daily crossword puzzles, already meant to be downloaded
and printed, and then organizes them and packs them into a easy to print PDF.

Requirements...
- Home directory file named "Documents", case matters.
- Make executable (chmod +x filepath/crsswrd.sh)

Setting up a cron job is recommended, so you can have a backlog automatically made.
